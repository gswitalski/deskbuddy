# AI Rules for DeskBuddy

DeskBuddy is a web-based desk booking system that rescues office warriors from the dreaded “Oops, someone’s in my spot” drama. It supports up to 200 users and 50 desks, letting employees snag full-day spots, cancel on the fly, and review their reservation history, while admins wield a power panel to manage desks and user accounts. Built solo (with an AI sidekick) in just two weeks, it’s the lean MVP every modern workplace needs for conflict-free seating.

## Coding practices

### Guidelines for clean code

- Use feedback from linters to improve the code when making changes.
- Prioritize error handling and edge cases.
- Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
- Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
- Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
- Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead.
- Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
- Consider using custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling.
